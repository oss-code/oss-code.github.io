 *
 * Apple extension for use to manage externally allocated buffers used with cl_mem objects with CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR
 *
 * Registers a user callback function that will be called when the memory object is deleted and its resources
 * freed. Each call to clSetMemObjectCallbackFn registers the specified user callback function on a callback
 * stack associated with memobj. The registered user callback functions are called in the reverse order in
 * which they were registered. The user callback functions are called and then the memory object is deleted
 * and its resources freed. This provides a mechanism for the application (and libraries) using memobj to be
 * notified when the memory referenced by host_ptr, specified when the memory object is created and used as
 * the storage bits for the memory object, can be reused or freed.
 *
 * The application may not call CL api&apos;s with the cl_mem object passed to the pfn_notify.
 *
 * Please check for the &quot;cl_APPLE_SetMemObjectDestructor&quot; extension using clGetDeviceInfo(CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS)
 * before using.
