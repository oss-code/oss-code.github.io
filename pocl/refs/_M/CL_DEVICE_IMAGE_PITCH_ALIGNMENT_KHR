 *
 * This extension allows a 2D image to be created from a cl_mem buffer without
 * a copy. The type associated with a 2D image created from a buffer in an
 * OpenCL program is image2d_t. Both the sampler and sampler-less read_image
 * built-in functions are supported for 2D images and 2D images created from
 * a buffer.  Similarly, the write_image built-ins are also supported for 2D
 * images created from a buffer.
 *
 * When the 2D image from buffer is created, the client must specify the
 * width, height, image format (i.e. channel order and channel data type)
 * and optionally the row pitch.
 *
 * The pitch specified must be a multiple of
 * CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_PITCH_ALIGNMENT_KHR pixels.
 * The base address of the buffer must be aligned to
 * CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_BASE_ADDRESS_ALIGNMENT_KHR pixels.
