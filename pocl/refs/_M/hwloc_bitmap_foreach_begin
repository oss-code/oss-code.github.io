 *
 * The loop must start with hwloc_bitmap_foreach_begin() and end
 * with hwloc_bitmap_foreach_end() followed by a terminating &apos;;&apos;.
 *
 * \p index is the loop variable; it should be an unsigned int.  The
 * first iteration will set \p index to the lowest index in the bitmap.
 * Successive iterations will iterate through, in order, all remaining
 * indexes set in the bitmap.  To be specific: each iteration will return a
 * value for \p index such that hwloc_bitmap_isset(bitmap, index) is true.
 *
 * The assert prevents the loop from being infinite if the bitmap is infinite.
