<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Support/GenericDomTree.h' l='558'>/// Inform the dominator tree about a CFG edge deletion and update the tree.
  ///
  /// This function has to be called just after making the update on the actual
  /// CFG. An internal functions checks if the edge doesn&apos;t exist in the CFG in
  /// DEBUG mode. There cannot be any other updates that the
  /// dominator tree doesn&apos;t know about.
  ///
  /// Note that for postdominators it automatically takes care of deleting
  /// a reverse edge internally (so there&apos;s no need to swap the parameters).
