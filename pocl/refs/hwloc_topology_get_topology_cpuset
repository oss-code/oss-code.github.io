 *
 * \return the CPU set of logical processors of the system for which hwloc
 * provides topology information. This is equivalent to the cpuset of the
 * system object. If the topology is the result of a combination of several
 * systems, NULL is returned.
 *
 * \note The returned cpuset is not newly allocated and should thus not be
 * changed or freed; hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used to obtain a local copy.
