 *
 * If not \c NULL, \p refname defines an identifier string
 * for the reference topology which was used as a base when
 * computing this difference.
 * This identifier is usually the name of the other XML file
 * that contains the reference topology.
 * This attribute is given back when reading the diff from XML.
 *
 * \note The XML buffer should later be freed with hwloc_free_xmlbuffer().
 *
 * \note The \p topology parameter must be a valid topology
 * but it is not required that it is related to \p diff.
