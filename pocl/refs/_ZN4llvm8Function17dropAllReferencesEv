<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/Function.h' l='699'>/// dropAllReferences() - This method causes all the subinstructions to &quot;let
  /// go&quot; of all references that they are maintaining.  This allows one to
  /// &apos;delete&apos; a whole module at a time, even though there may be circular
  /// references... first all references are dropped, and all use counts go to
  /// zero.  Then everything is deleted for real.  Note that no operations are
  /// valid on an object that has &quot;dropped all references&quot;, except operator
  /// delete.
  ///
  /// Since no other object in the module can have references into the body of a
  /// function, dropping all references deletes the entire body of the function,
  /// including any contained basic blocks.
