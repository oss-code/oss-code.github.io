    /// inserting a new call edge.
    ///
    /// This is trivial whenever the target is in the same SCC as the source or
    /// the edge is an outgoing edge to some descendant SCC. In these cases
    /// there is no change to the cyclic structure of SCCs or RefSCCs.
    ///
    /// To further make calling this convenient, it also handles inserting
    /// already existing edges.</doc>
