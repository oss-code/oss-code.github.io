 *
 * \note This function is deprecated in favor of hwloc_obj_type_snprintf()
 * and hwloc_obj_attr_snprintf() since it is not very flexible and
 * only prints physical/OS indexes.
 *
 * Fill string \p string up to \p size characters with the description
 * of topology object \p obj in topology \p topology.
 *
 * If \p verbose is set, a longer description is used. Otherwise a
 * short description is used.
 *
 * \p indexprefix is used to prefix the \p os_index attribute number of
 * the object in the description. If \c NULL, the \c # character is used.
 *
 * If \p size is 0, \p string may safely be \c NULL.
 *
 * \return the number of character that were actually written if not truncating,
 * or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0).
