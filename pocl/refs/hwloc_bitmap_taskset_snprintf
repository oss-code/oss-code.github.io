 *
 * The taskset command manipulates bitmap strings that contain a single
 * (possible very long) hexadecimal number starting with 0x.
 *
 * Up to \p buflen characters may be written in buffer \p buf.
 *
 * If \p buflen is 0, \p buf may safely be \c NULL.
 *
 * \return the number of character that were actually written if not truncating,
 * or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0).
