<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1991'>/** \brief Query the CPUs near the physical NUMA node(s) and binding policy of
 * the memory identified by (\p addr, \p len ).
 *
 * This function has two output parameters: \p cpuset and \p policy.
 * The values returned in these parameters depend on both the \p flags
 * passed in and the memory binding policies and nodesets of the pages
 * in the address range.
 *
 * If ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT is specified, the target pages are first
 * checked to see if they all have the same memory binding policy and
 * nodeset.  If they do not, -1 is returned and errno is set to EXDEV.
 * If they are identical across all pages, the policy is returned in
 * \p policy.  \p cpuset is set to the union of CPUs near the NUMA
 * node(s) in the nodeset.
 *
 * If ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT is not specified, the union of all NUMA
 * node(s) containing pages in the address range is calculated.  \p
 * cpuset is then set to the CPUs near the NUMA node(s) in this union.
 * If all pages in the target have the same policy, it is returned in
 * \p policy.  Otherwise, \p policy is set to ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_MIXED.
 *
 * If any other flags are specified, -1 is returned and errno is set
 * to EINVAL.
