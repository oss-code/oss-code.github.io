       *  @brief  Removes first element.
       *
       *  This is a typical stack operation.  It shrinks the %forward_list
       *  by one.  Due to the nature of a %forward_list this operation can
       *  be done in constant time, and only invalidates iterators/references
       *  to the element being removed.
       *
       *  Note that no data is returned, and if the first element&apos;s data
       *  is needed, it should be retrieved before pop_front() is
       *  called.
