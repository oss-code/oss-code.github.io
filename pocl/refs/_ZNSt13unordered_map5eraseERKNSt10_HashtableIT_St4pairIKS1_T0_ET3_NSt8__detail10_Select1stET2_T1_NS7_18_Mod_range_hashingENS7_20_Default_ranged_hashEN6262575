       *  @brief Erases elements according to the provided key.

       *  This function erases all the elements located by the given key from
       *  an %unordered_map. For an %unordered_map the result of this function
       *  can only be 0 (not present) or 1 (present).
       *  Note that this function only erases the element, and that if the
       *  element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched in
       *  any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
