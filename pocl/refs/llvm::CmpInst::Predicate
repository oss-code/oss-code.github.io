<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/InstrTypes.h' l='845'>/// This enumeration lists the possible predicates for CmpInst subclasses.
  /// Values in the range 0-31 are reserved for FCmpInst, while values in the
  /// range 32-64 are reserved for ICmpInst. This is necessary to ensure the
  /// predicate values are not overlapping between the classes.
  ///
  /// Some passes (e.g. InstCombine) depend on the bit-wise characteristics of
  /// FCMP_* values. Changing the bit patterns requires a potential change to
  /// those passes.</doc>
