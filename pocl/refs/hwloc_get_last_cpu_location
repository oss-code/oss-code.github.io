<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1512'>/** \brief Get the last physical CPU where the current process or thread ran.
 *
 * The operating system may move some tasks from one processor
 * to another at any time according to their binding,
 * so this function may return something that is already
 * outdated.
 *
 * \p flags can include either ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_PROCESS or ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_THREAD to
 * specify whether the query should be for the whole process (union of all CPUs
 * on which all threads are running), or only the current thread. If the
 * process is single-threaded, flags can be set to zero to let hwloc use
 * whichever method is available on the underlying OS.
