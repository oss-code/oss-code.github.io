 *
 * Ignore all objects from the given type as long as they do not bring any structure:
 * Each ignored object should have a single children or be the only child of its parent.
 * The bottom-level type ::HWLOC_OBJ_PU may not be ignored.
 * I/O objects may not be ignored, topology flags should be used to configure
 * their discovery instead.
