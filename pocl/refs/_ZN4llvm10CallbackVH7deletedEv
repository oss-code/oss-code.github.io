  /// Called when this-&gt;getValPtr() is destroyed, inside ~Value(), so you
  /// may call any non-virtual Value method on getValPtr(), but no subclass
  /// methods.  If WeakTrackingVH were implemented as a CallbackVH, it would use
  /// this
  /// method to call setValPtr(NULL).  AssertingVH would use this method to
  /// cause an assertion failure.
  ///
  /// All implementations must remove the reference from this object to the
  /// Value that&apos;s being destroyed.</doc>
