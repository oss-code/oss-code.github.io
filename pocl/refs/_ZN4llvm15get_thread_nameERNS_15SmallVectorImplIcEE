<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Support/Threading.h' l='160'>/// \brief Get the name of the current thread.  The level of support for
  /// getting a thread&apos;s name varies wildly across operating systems, and it
  /// is not even guaranteed that if you can successfully set a thread&apos;s name
  /// that you can later get it back.  This function is intended for diagnostic
  /// purposes, and as with setting a thread&apos;s name no indication of whether
  /// the operation succeeded or failed is returned.</doc>
