<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1527'>/** \brief Get the last physical CPU where a process ran.
 *
 * The operating system may move some tasks from one processor
 * to another at any time according to their binding,
 * so this function may return something that is already
 * outdated.
 *
 * \note \p hwloc_pid_t is \p pid_t on Unix platforms,
 * and \p HANDLE on native Windows platforms.
 *
 * \note As a special case on Linux, if a tid (thread ID) is supplied
 * instead of a pid (process ID) and ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_THREAD is passed in flags,
 * the last CPU location of that specific thread is returned.
 *
 * \note On non-Linux systems, ::HWLOC_CPUBIND_THREAD can not be used in \p flags.
