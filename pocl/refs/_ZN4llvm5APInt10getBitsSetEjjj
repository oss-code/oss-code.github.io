<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/ADT/APInt.h' l='587'>/// \brief Get a value with a block of bits set.
  ///
  /// Constructs an APInt value that has a contiguous range of bits set. The
  /// bits from loBit (inclusive) to hiBit (exclusive) will be set. All other
  /// bits will be zero. For example, with parameters(32, 0, 16) you would get
  /// 0x0000FFFF. If hiBit is less than loBit then the set bits &quot;wrap&quot;. For
  /// example, with parameters (32, 28, 4), you would get 0xF000000F.
  ///
  /// \param numBits the intended bit width of the result
  /// \param loBit the index of the lowest bit set.
  /// \param hiBit the index of the highest bit set.
  ///
  /// \returns An APInt value with the requested bits set.</doc>
