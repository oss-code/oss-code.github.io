<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='2193'>/** \brief Insert a new group object inside a custom topology
 *
 * An object with type ::HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP is inserted as a new child
 * of object \p parent.
 *
 * \p groupdepth is the depth attribute to be given to the new object.
 * It may for instance be 0 for top-level groups, 1 for their children,
 * and so on.
 *
 * The custom topology \p newtopology must have been prepared with
 * hwloc_topology_set_custom() and not loaded with hwloc_topology_load()
 * yet.
 *
 * \p parent may be either the root of \p topology or an object that
 * was added earlier through hwloc_custom_insert_group_object_by_parent().
 *
 * \note The cpuset and nodeset of the new group object are NULL because
 * these sets are meaningless when assembling multiple topologies.
 *
 * \note The cpuset and nodeset of the \p parent object are not modified.
