<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Target/TargetOptions.h' l='75'>/// Identify a debugger for &quot;tuning&quot; the debug info.
  ///
  /// The &quot;debugger tuning&quot; concept allows us to present a more intuitive
  /// interface that unpacks into different sets of defaults for the various
  /// individual feature-flag settings, that suit the preferences of the
  /// various debuggers.  However, it&apos;s worth remembering that debuggers are
  /// not the only consumers of debug info, and some variations in DWARF might
  /// better be treated as target/platform issues. Fundamentally,
  /// o if the feature is useful (or not) to a particular debugger, regardless
  ///   of the target, that&apos;s a tuning decision;
  /// o if the feature is useful (or not) on a particular platform, regardless
  ///   of the debugger, that&apos;s a target decision.
  /// It&apos;s not impossible to see both factors in some specific case.
  ///
  /// The &quot;tuning&quot; should be used to set defaults for individual feature flags
  /// in DwarfDebug; if a given feature has a more specific command-line option,
  /// that option should take precedence over the tuning.</doc>
