<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Support/Signals.h' l='64'>/// This function registers a function to be called when the user &quot;interrupts&quot;
  /// the program (typically by pressing ctrl-c).  When the user interrupts the
  /// program, the specified interrupt function is called instead of the program
  /// being killed, and the interrupt function automatically disabled.  Note
  /// that interrupt functions are not allowed to call any non-reentrant
  /// functions.  An null interrupt function pointer disables the current
  /// installed function.  Note also that the handler may be executed on a
  /// different thread on some platforms.
  /// @brief Register a function to be called when ctrl-c is pressed.</doc>
