<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Transforms/Utils/Cloning.h' l='84'>/// CloneBasicBlock - Return a copy of the specified basic block, but without
/// embedding the block into a particular function.  The block returned is an
/// exact copy of the specified basic block, without any remapping having been
/// performed.  Because of this, this is only suitable for applications where
/// the basic block will be inserted into the same function that it was cloned
/// from (loop unrolling would use this, for example).
///
/// Also, note that this function makes a direct copy of the basic block, and
/// can thus produce illegal LLVM code.  In particular, it will copy any PHI
/// nodes from the original block, even though there are no predecessors for the
/// newly cloned block (thus, phi nodes will have to be updated).  Also, this
/// block will branch to the old successors of the original block: these
/// successors will have to have any PHI nodes updated to account for the new
/// incoming edges.
///
/// The correlation between instructions in the source and result basic blocks
/// is recorded in the VMap map.
///
/// If you have a particular suffix you&apos;d like to use to add to any cloned
/// names, specify it as the optional third parameter.
///
/// If you would like the basic block to be auto-inserted into the end of a
/// function, you can specify it as the optional fourth parameter.
///
/// If you would like to collect additional information about the cloned
/// function, you can specify a ClonedCodeInfo object with the optional fifth
/// parameter.
