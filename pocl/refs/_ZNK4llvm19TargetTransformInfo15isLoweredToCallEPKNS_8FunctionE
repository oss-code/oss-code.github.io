<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/TargetTransformInfo.h' l='320'>/// \brief Test whether calls to a function lower to actual program function
  /// calls.
  ///
  /// The idea is to test whether the program is likely to require a &apos;call&apos;
  /// instruction or equivalent in order to call the given function.
  ///
  /// FIXME: It&apos;s not clear that this is a good or useful query API. Client&apos;s
  /// should probably move to simpler cost metrics using the above.
  /// Alternatively, we could split the cost interface into distinct code-size
  /// and execution-speed costs. This would allow modelling the core of this
  /// query more accurately as a call is a single small instruction, but
  /// incurs significant execution cost.</doc>
