 * cpuset
 *
 * If neither ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS nor ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD is
 * specified, the current process is assumed to be single-threaded.
 * This is the most portable form as it permits hwloc to use either
 * process-based OS functions or thread-based OS functions, depending
 * on which are available.

 * \return -1 with errno set to ENOSYS if the action is not supported
 * \return -1 with errno set to EXDEV if the binding cannot be enforced
