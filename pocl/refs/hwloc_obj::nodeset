                                          *
                                          * This is the set of NUMA nodes for which there are NODE objects in the
                                          * topology under or above this object, i.e. which are known to be physically
                                          * contained in this object or containing it and known how (the children path
                                          * between this object and the NODE objects).
                                          *
                                          * In the end, these nodes are those that are close to the current object.
                                          *
                                          * If the ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_WHOLE_SYSTEM configuration flag is set, some of
                                          * these nodes may not be allowed for allocation, see allowed_nodeset.
                                          *
                                          * If there are no NUMA nodes in the machine, all the memory is close to this
                                          * object, so \p nodeset is full.
                                          *
                                          * \note Its value must not be changed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used instead.
