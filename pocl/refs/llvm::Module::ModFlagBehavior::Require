<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/Module.h' l='120'>/// Adds a requirement that another module flag be present and have a
    /// specified value after linking is performed. The value must be a metadata
    /// pair, where the first element of the pair is the ID of the module flag
    /// to be restricted, and the second element of the pair is the value the
    /// module flag should be restricted to. This behavior can be used to
    /// restrict the allowable results (via triggering of an error) of linking
    /// IDs with the **Override** behavior.</doc>
