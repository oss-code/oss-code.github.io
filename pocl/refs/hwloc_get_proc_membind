<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1910'>/** \brief Query the default memory binding policy and physical locality of the
 * specified process (the locality is returned in \p cpuset as CPUs
 * near the locality&apos;s actual NUMA node(s)).
 *
 * This function has two output parameters: \p cpuset and \p policy.
 * The values returned in these parameters depend on both the \p flags
 * passed in and the current memory binding policies and nodesets in
 * the queried target.
 *
 * Passing the ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS flag specifies that the query
 * target is the current policies and nodesets for all the threads in
 * the specified process.  If ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS is not specified
 * (which is the most portable method), the process is assumed to be
 * single threaded.  This allows hwloc to use either process-based OS
 * functions or thread-based OS functions, depending on which are
 * available.
 *
 * Note that it does not make sense to pass ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD to
 * this function.
 *
 * If ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT is specified, hwloc will check the default
 * memory policies and nodesets for all threads in the specified
 * process.  If they are not identical, -1 is returned and errno is
 * set to EXDEV.  If they are identical, the policy is returned in \p
 * policy.  \p cpuset is set to the union of CPUs near the NUMA
 * node(s) in the nodeset.
 *
 * Otherwise, the default nodeset from each thread is logically OR&apos;ed
 * together.  \p cpuset is set to the union of CPUs near the NUMA
 * node(s) in the resulting nodeset.  If all threads&apos; default policies
 * are the same, \p policy is set to that policy.  If they are
 * different, \p policy is set to ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_MIXED.
 *
 * If any other flags are specified, -1 is returned and errno is set
 * to EINVAL.
 *
 * \note \p hwloc_pid_t is \p pid_t on Unix platforms,
 * and \p HANDLE on native Windows platforms.
