<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='2266'>/** \brief Set the application-specific callback for exporting object userdata
 *
 * The object userdata pointer is not exported to XML by default because hwloc
 * does not know what it contains.
 *
 * This function lets applications set \p export_cb to a callback function
 * that converts this opaque userdata into an exportable string.
 *
 * \p export_cb is invoked during XML export for each object whose
 * \p userdata pointer is not \c NULL.
 * The callback should use hwloc_export_obj_userdata() or
 * hwloc_export_obj_userdata_base64() to actually export
 * something to XML (possibly multiple times per object).
 *
 * \p export_cb may be set to \c NULL if userdata should not be exported to XML.
 *
 * \note The topology-specific userdata pointer is ignored when exporting to XML.
