<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='2287'>/** \brief Export some object userdata to XML
 *
 * This function may only be called from within the export() callback passed
 * to hwloc_topology_set_userdata_export_callback().
 * It may be invoked one of multiple times to export some userdata to XML.
 * The \p buffer content of length \p length is stored with optional name
 * \p name.
 *
 * When importing this XML file, the import() callback (if set) will be
 * called exactly as many times as hwloc_export_obj_userdata() was called
 * during export(). It will receive the corresponding \p name, \p buffer
 * and \p length arguments.
 *
 * \p reserved, \p topology and \p obj must be the first three parameters
 * that were given to the export callback.
 *
 * Only printable characters may be exported to XML string attributes.
 * If a non-printable character is passed in \p name or \p buffer,
 * the function returns -1 with errno set to EINVAL.
 *
 * If exporting binary data, the application should first encode into
 * printable characters only (or use hwloc_export_obj_userdata_base64()).
 * It should also take care of portability issues if the export may
 * be reimported on a different architecture.
