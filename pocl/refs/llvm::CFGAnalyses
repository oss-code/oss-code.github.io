/// The CFG of a function is defined as the set of basic blocks and the edges
/// between them. Changing the set of basic blocks in a function is enough to
/// mutate the CFG. Mutating the condition of a branch or argument of an
/// invoked function does not mutate the CFG, but changing the successor labels
