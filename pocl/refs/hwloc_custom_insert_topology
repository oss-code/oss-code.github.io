<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='2171'>/** \brief Insert an existing topology inside a custom topology
 *
 * Duplicate the existing topology \p oldtopology inside a new
 * custom topology \p newtopology as a leaf of object \p newparent.
 *
 * If \p oldroot is not \c NULL, duplicate \p oldroot and all its
 * children instead of the entire \p oldtopology. Passing the root
 * object of \p oldtopology in \p oldroot is equivalent to passing
 * \c NULL.
 *
 * The custom topology \p newtopology must have been prepared with
 * hwloc_topology_set_custom() and not loaded with hwloc_topology_load()
 * yet.
 *
 * \p newparent may be either the root of \p newtopology or an object
 * that was added through hwloc_custom_insert_group_object_by_parent().
 *
 * \note The cpuset and nodeset of the \p newparent object are not
 * modified based on the contents of \p oldtopology.
