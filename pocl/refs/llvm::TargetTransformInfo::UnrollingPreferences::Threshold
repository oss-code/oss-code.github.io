    /// getUserCost values returned by this API, and the expectation is that
    /// the unrolled loop&apos;s instructions when run through that interface should
    /// not exceed this cost. However, this is only an estimate. Also, specific
    /// loops may be unrolled even with a cost above this threshold if deemed
