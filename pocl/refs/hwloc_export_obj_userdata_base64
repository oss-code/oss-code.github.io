 *
 * This function is similar to hwloc_export_obj_userdata() but it encodes
 * the input buffer into printable characters before exporting.
 * On import, decoding is automatically performed before the data is given
 * to the import() callback if any.
 *
 * This function may only be called from within the export() callback passed
 * to hwloc_topology_set_userdata_export_callback().
 *
 * The function does not take care of portability issues if the export
 * may be reimported on a different architecture.
