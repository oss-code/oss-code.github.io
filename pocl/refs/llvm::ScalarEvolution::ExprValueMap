<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/ScalarEvolution.h' l='1065'>/// ExprValueMap -- This map records the original values from which
  /// the SCEV expr is generated from.
  ///
  /// We want to represent the mapping as SCEV -&gt; ValueOffsetPair instead
  /// of SCEV -&gt; Value:
  /// Suppose we know S1 expands to V1, and
  ///  S1 = S2 + C_a
  ///  S3 = S2 + C_b
  /// where C_a and C_b are different SCEVConstants. Then we&apos;d like to
  /// expand S3 as V1 - C_a + C_b instead of expanding S2 literally.
  /// It is helpful when S2 is a complex SCEV expr.
  ///
  /// In order to do that, we represent ExprValueMap as a mapping from
  /// SCEV to ValueOffsetPair. We will save both S1-&gt;{V1, 0} and
  /// S2-&gt;{V1, C_a} into the map when we create SCEV for V1. When S3
  /// is expanded, it will first expand S2 to V1 - C_a because of
  /// S2-&gt;{V1, C_a} in the map, then expand S3 to V1 - C_a + C_b.
  ///
  /// Note: S-&gt;{V, Offset} in the ExprValueMap means S can be expanded
  /// to V - Offset.</doc>
