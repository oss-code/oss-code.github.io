<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/InstrTypes.h' l='776'>/// A no-op cast is one that can be effected without changing any bits.
  /// It implies that the source and destination types are the same size. The
  /// DataLayout argument is to determine the pointer size when examining casts
  /// involving Integer and Pointer types. They are no-op casts if the integer
  /// is the same size as the pointer. However, pointer size varies with
  /// platform.
