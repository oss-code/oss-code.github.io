<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='887'>/** \brief Enable XML-file based topology.
 *
 * Gather topology information from the XML file given at \p xmlpath.
 * Setting the environment variable HWLOC_XMLFILE may also result in this behavior.
 * This file may have been generated earlier with hwloc_topology_export_xml()
 * or lstopo file.xml.
 *
 * Note that this function does not actually load topology
 * information; it just tells hwloc where to load it from.  You&apos;ll
 * still need to invoke hwloc_topology_load() to actually load the
 * topology information.
 *
 * \return -1 with errno set to EINVAL on failure to read the XML file.
 *
 * \note See also hwloc_topology_set_userdata_import_callback()
 * for importing application-specific object userdata.
 *
 * \note For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
 * return success.  To have hwloc still actually call OS-specific hooks, the
 * ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM has to be set to assert that the loaded
 * file is really the underlying system.
 *
 * \note On success, the XML component replaces the previously enabled
 * component (if any), but the topology is not actually modified until
 * hwloc_topology_load().
