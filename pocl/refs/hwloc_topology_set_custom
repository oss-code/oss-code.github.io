<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='943'>/** \brief Prepare the topology for custom assembly.
 *
 * The topology then contains a single root object.
 * It must then be built by inserting other topologies with
 * hwloc_custom_insert_topology() or single objects with
 * hwloc_custom_insert_group_object_by_parent().
 * hwloc_topology_load() must be called to finalize the new
 * topology as usual.
 *
 * \note If nothing is inserted in the topology,
 * hwloc_topology_load() will fail with errno set to EINVAL.
 *
 * \note The cpuset and nodeset of the root object are NULL because
 * these sets are meaningless when assembling multiple topologies.
 *
 * \note On success, the custom component replaces the previously enabled
 * component (if any), but the topology is not actually modified until
 * hwloc_topology_load().
