<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/CGSCCPassManager.h' l='244'>/// Worklist of the SCCs queued for processing.
  ///
  /// When a pass refines the graph and creates new SCCs or causes them to have
  /// a different shape or set of component functions it should add the SCCs to
  /// this worklist so that we visit them in the refined form.
  ///
  /// Note that if the SCCs are part of a RefSCC that is added to the \c
  /// RCWorklist, they don&apos;t need to be added here as visiting the RefSCC will
  /// be sufficient to re-visit the SCCs within it.
  ///
  /// This worklist is in reverse post-order, as we pop off the back in order
  /// to observe SCCs in post-order. When adding SCCs, clients should add them
  /// in reverse post-order.</doc>
