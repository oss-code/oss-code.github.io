<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/TargetTransformInfo.h' l='357'>/// If complete unrolling will reduce the cost of the loop, we will boost
    /// the Threshold by a certain percent to allow more aggressive complete
    /// unrolling. This value provides the maximum boost percentage that we
    /// can apply to Threshold (The value should be no less than 100).
    /// BoostedThreshold = Threshold * min(RolledCost / UnrolledCost,
    ///                                    MaxPercentThresholdBoost / 100)
    /// E.g. if complete unrolling reduces the loop execution time by 50%
    /// then we boost the threshold by the factor of 2x. If unrolling is not
    /// expected to reduce the running time, then we do not increase the
    /// threshold.</doc>
