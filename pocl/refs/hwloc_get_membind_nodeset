<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1761'>/** \brief Query the default memory binding policy and physical locality of the
 * current process or thread.
 *
 * This function has two output parameters: \p nodeset and \p policy.
 * The values returned in these parameters depend on both the \p flags
 * passed in and the current memory binding policies and nodesets in
 * the queried target.
 *
 * Passing the ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS flag specifies that the query
 * target is the current policies and nodesets for all the threads in
 * the current process.  Passing ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD specifies that
 * the query target is the current policy and nodeset for only the
 * thread invoking this function.
 *
 * If neither of these flags are passed (which is the most portable
 * method), the process is assumed to be single threaded.  This allows
 * hwloc to use either process-based OS functions or thread-based OS
 * functions, depending on which are available.
 *
 * ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT is only meaningful when ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS
 * is also specified.  In this case, hwloc will check the default
 * memory policies and nodesets for all threads in the process.  If
 * they are not identical, -1 is returned and errno is set to EXDEV.
 * If they are identical, the values are returned in \p nodeset and \p
 * policy.
 *
 * Otherwise, if ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS is specified (and
 * ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT is \em not specified), \p nodeset is set to
 * the logical OR of all threads&apos; default nodeset.  If all threads&apos;
 * default policies are the same, \p policy is set to that policy.  If
 * they are different, \p policy is set to ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_MIXED.
 *
 * In the ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD case (or when neither
 * ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS or ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD is specified), there
 * is only one nodeset and policy; they are returned in \p nodeset and
 * \p policy, respectively.
 *
 * If any other flags are specified, -1 is returned and errno is set
 * to EINVAL.
