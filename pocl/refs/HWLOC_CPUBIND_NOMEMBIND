<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1432'>/** \brief Avoid any effect on memory binding
   *
   * On some operating systems, some CPU binding function would also
   * bind the memory on the corresponding NUMA node.  It is often not
   * a problem for the application, but if it is, setting this flag
   * will make hwloc avoid using OS functions that would also bind
   * memory.  This will however reduce the support of CPU bindings,
   * i.e. potentially return -1 with errno set to ENOSYS in some
   * cases.
   *
   * This flag is only meaningful when used with functions that set
   * the CPU binding.  It is ignored when used with functions that get
   * CPU binding information.
