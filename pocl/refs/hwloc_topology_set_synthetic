<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='858'>/** \brief Enable synthetic topology.
 *
 * Gather topology information from the given \p description,
 * a space-separated string of numbers describing
 * the arity of each level.
 * Each number may be prefixed with a type and a colon to enforce the type
 * of a level.  If only some level types are enforced, hwloc will try to
 * choose the other types according to usual topologies, but it may fail
 * and you may have to specify more level types manually.
 * See also the \ref synthetic.
 *
 * If \p description was properly parsed and describes a valid topology
 * configuration, this function returns 0.
 * Otherwise -1 is returned and errno is set to EINVAL.
 *
 * Note that this function does not actually load topology
 * information; it just tells hwloc where to load it from.  You&apos;ll
 * still need to invoke hwloc_topology_load() to actually load the
 * topology information.
 *
 * \note For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just
 * return success.
 *
 * \note On success, the synthetic component replaces the previously enabled
 * component (if any), but the topology is not actually modified until
 * hwloc_topology_load().
