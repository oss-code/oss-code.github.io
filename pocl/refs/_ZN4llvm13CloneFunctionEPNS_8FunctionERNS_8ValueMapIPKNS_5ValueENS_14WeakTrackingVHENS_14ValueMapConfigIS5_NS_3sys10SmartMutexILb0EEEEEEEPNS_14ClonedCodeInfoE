/// function&apos;s module.  Also, any references specified in the VMap are changed
/// to refer to their mapped value instead of the original one.  If any of the
/// arguments to the function are in the VMap, the arguments are deleted from
/// the resultant function.  The VMap is updated to include mappings from all of
/// the instructions and basicblocks in the function from their old to new
/// values.  The final argument captures information about the cloned code if
/// non-null.

/// VMap contains no non-identity GlobalValue mappings and debug info metadata
