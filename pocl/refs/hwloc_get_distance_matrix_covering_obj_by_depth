 * Return a distance matrix that describes depth \p depth and covers at
 * least object \p obj and all its children.
 *
 * When looking for the distance between some objects, a common ancestor should
 * be passed in \p obj.
 *
 * \p firstp is set to logical index of the first object described by the matrix.
 *
 * The returned structure belongs to the hwloc library. The caller should
