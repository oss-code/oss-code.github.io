   *
   * By default, I/O devices are ignored. This flag enables I/O device
   * detection using the pci backend. Only the common PCI devices (GPUs,
   * NICs, block devices, ...) and host bridges (objects that connect the host
   * objects to an I/O subsystem) will be added to the topology.
   * Additionally it also enables MemoryModule misc objects.
   * Uncommon devices and other bridges (such as PCI-to-PCI bridges) will be
   * ignored.
