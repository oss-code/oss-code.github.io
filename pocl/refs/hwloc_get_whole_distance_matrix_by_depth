 *
 * \return a distances structure containing a matrix with all distances
 * between all objects at the given depth.
 *
 * Slot i+nbobjs*j contains the distance from the object of logical index i
 * the object of logical index j.
 *
 * \note This function only returns matrices covering the whole topology,
 * without any unknown distance value. Those matrices are available in
 * top-level object of the hierarchy. Matrices of lower objects are not
 * reported here since they cover only part of the machine.
 *
 * The returned structure belongs to the hwloc library. The caller should
 * not modify or free it.
 *
 * \return \c NULL if no such distance matrix exists.
