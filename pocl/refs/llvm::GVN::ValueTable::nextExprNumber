<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Transforms/Scalar/GVN.h' l='93'>// Expressions is the vector of Expression. ExprIdx is the mapping from
    // value number to the index of Expression in Expressions. We use it
    // instead of a DenseMap because filling such mapping is faster than
    // filling a DenseMap and the compile time is a little better.</doc>
