                                          *
                                          * This includes not only the same as the nodeset field, but also the NUMA
                                          * nodes for which topology information is unknown or incomplete, and the nodes
                                          * that are ignored when the ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_WHOLE_SYSTEM flag is not set.
                                          * Thus no corresponding NODE object may be found in the topology, because the
                                          * precise position is undefined. It is however known that it would be
                                          * somewhere under this object.
                                          *
                                          * If there are no NUMA nodes in the machine, all the memory is close to this
                                          * object, so \p complete_nodeset is full.
                                          *
                                          * \note Its value must not be changed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used instead.
