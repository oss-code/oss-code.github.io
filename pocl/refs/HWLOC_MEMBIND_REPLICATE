   * memory will attempt to be serviced from the NUMA node local to
   * the reading thread. Replicating can be useful when multiple
   * threads from the specified NUMA nodes will be sharing the same
   * read-only data.
   *
   * This policy can only be used with existing memory allocations
   * (i.e., the hwloc_set_*membind*() functions); it cannot be used
   * with functions that allocate new memory (i.e., the hwloc_alloc*()
   * functions).
