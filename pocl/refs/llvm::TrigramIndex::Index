<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Support/TrigramIndex.h' l='60'>// Index holds a list of rules indices for each trigram. The same indices
  // are used in Counts to store per-rule limits.
  // If a trigram is too common (&gt;4 rules with it), we stop tracking it,
  // which increases the probability for a need to match using regex, but
  // decreases the costs in the regular case.</doc>
