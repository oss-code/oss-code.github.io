 * If not \c NULL, \p refname will be filled with the identifier
 * string of the reference topology for the difference file,
 * if any was specified in the XML file.
 * This identifier is usually the name of the other XML file
 * that contains the reference topology.

 * \note The \p topology parameter must be a valid topology
 * but it is not required that it is related to \p diff.
 *
 * \note the pointer returned in refname should later be freed
 * by the caller.
