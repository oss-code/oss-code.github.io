<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/ScalarEvolution.h' l='692'>/// Returns the maximum trip count of this loop as a normal unsigned
  /// value. Returns 0 if the trip count is unknown or not constant. This
  /// &quot;trip count&quot; assumes that control exits via ExitingBlock. More
  /// precisely, it is the number of times that control may reach ExitingBlock
  /// before taking the branch. For loops with multiple exits, it may not be
  /// the number times that the loop header executes if the loop exits
  /// prematurely via another branch.</doc>
