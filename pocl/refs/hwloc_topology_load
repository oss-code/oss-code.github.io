 *
 * Build the actual topology once initialized with hwloc_topology_init() and
 * tuned with \ref hwlocality_configuration routines.
 * No other routine may be called earlier using this topology context.
 *
 * \param topology is the topology to be loaded with objects.
 *
 * \return 0 on success, -1 on error.
 *
 * \note On failure, the topology is reinitialized. It should be either
 * destroyed with hwloc_topology_destroy() or configured and loaded again.
 *
 * \note This function may be called only once per topology.
