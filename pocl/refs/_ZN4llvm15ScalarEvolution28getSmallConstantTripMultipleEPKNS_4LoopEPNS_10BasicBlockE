<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/ScalarEvolution.h' l='714'>/// Returns the largest constant divisor of the trip count of this loop as a
  /// normal unsigned value, if possible. This means that the actual trip
  /// count is always a multiple of the returned value (don&apos;t forget the trip
  /// count could very well be zero as well!). As explained in the comments
  /// for getSmallConstantTripCount, this assumes that control exits the loop
  /// via ExitingBlock.</doc>
