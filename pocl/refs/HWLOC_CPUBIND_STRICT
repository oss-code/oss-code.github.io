   *
   * By default, when the designated CPUs are all busy while other
   * CPUs are idle, operating systems may execute the thread/process
   * on those other CPUs instead of the designated CPUs, to let them
   * progress anyway.  Strict binding means that the thread/process
   * will _never_ execute on other cpus than the designated CPUs, even
   * when those are busy with other tasks and other CPUs are idle.
   *
   * \note Depending on the operating system, strict binding may not
   * be possible (e.g., the OS does not implement it) or not allowed
   * (e.g., for an administrative reasons), and the function will fail
   * in that case.
   *
   * When retrieving the binding of a process, this flag checks
   * whether all its threads  actually have the same binding. If the
   * flag is not given, the binding of each thread will be
   * accumulated.
   *
   * \note This flag is meaningless when retrieving the binding of a
   * thread.
