/// The link may be a soft or a hard link, depending on the platform. The caller
/// may not assume which one. Currently on windows it creates a hard link since
/// soft links require extra privileges. On unix, it creates a soft link since

/// @param to The path to hard link to.
/// @param from The path to hard link from. This is created.
