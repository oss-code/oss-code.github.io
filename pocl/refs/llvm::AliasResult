<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/AliasAnalysis.h' l='66'>/// The possible results of an alias query.
///
/// These results are always computed between two MemoryLocation objects as
/// a query to some alias analysis.
///
/// Note that these are unscoped enumerations because we would like to support
/// implicitly testing a result for the existence of any possible aliasing with
/// a conversion to bool, but an &quot;enum class&quot; doesn&apos;t support this. The
/// canonical names from the literature are suffixed and unique anyways, and so
/// they serve as global constants in LLVM for these results.
///
/// See docs/AliasAnalysis.html for more information on the specific meanings
/// of these values.</doc>
