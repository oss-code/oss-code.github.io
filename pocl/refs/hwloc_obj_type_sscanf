<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1238'>/** \brief Return an object type and attributes from a type string.
 *
 * Convert strings such as &quot;Package&quot; or &quot;Cache&quot; into the corresponding types.
 * Matching is case-insensitive, and only the first letters are actually
 * required to match.
 *
 * Types that have specific attributes, for instance caches and groups,
 * may be returned in \p depthattrp and \p typeattrp. They are ignored
 * when these pointers are \c NULL.
 *
 * For instance &quot;L2i&quot; or &quot;L2iCache&quot; would return
 * type HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE in \p typep, 2 in \p depthattrp,
 * and HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE_TYPE_INSTRUCTION in \p typeattrp
 * (this last pointer should point to a hwloc_obj_cache_type_t).
 * &quot;Group3&quot; would return type HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP type and 3 in \p depthattrp.
 * Attributes that are not specified in the string (for instance &quot;Group&quot;
 * without a depth, or &quot;L2Cache&quot; without a cache type) are set to -1.
 *
 * \p typeattrp is only filled if the size specified in \p typeattrsize
 * is large enough. It is currently only used for caches, and the required
 * size is at least the size of hwloc_obj_cache_type_t.
 *
 * \return 0 if a type was correctly identified, otherwise -1.
 *
 * \note This is an extended version of the now deprecated hwloc_obj_type_of_string()
