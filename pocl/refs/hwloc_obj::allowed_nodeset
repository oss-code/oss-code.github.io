                                          *
                                          * This includes the NUMA memory nodes contained in this object which are
                                          * allowed for memory allocation, i.e. passing them to NUMA node-directed
                                          * memory allocation should not return permission errors. This is usually
                                          * restricted by administration rules.
                                          *
                                          * If there are no NUMA nodes in the machine, all the memory is close to this
                                          * object, so \p allowed_nodeset is full.
                                          *
                                          * \note Its value must not be changed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used instead.
