 *
 * If some NUMA nodes have no CPUs at all, this function never sets their
 * indexes in the output node set, even if a full CPU set is given in input.
 *
 * If the topology contains no NUMA nodes, the machine is considered
 * as a single memory node, and the following behavior is used:
 * If \p cpuset is empty, \p nodeset will be emptied as well.
 * Otherwise \p nodeset will be entirely filled.
