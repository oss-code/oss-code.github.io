<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/MemoryDependenceAnalysis.h' l='63'>/// This is a dependence on the specified instruction which clobbers the
    /// desired value.  The pointer member of the MemDepResult pair holds the
    /// instruction that clobbers the memory.  For example, this occurs when we
    /// see a may-aliased store to the memory location we care about.
    ///
    /// There are several cases that may be interesting here:
    ///   1. Loads are clobbered by may-alias stores.
    ///   2. Loads are considered clobbered by partially-aliased loads.  The
