			  * Objects which do not fit in the above but are
			  * detected by hwloc and are useful to take into
			  * account for affinity. For instance, some operating systems
			  * expose their arbitrary processors aggregation this
			  * way.  And hwloc may insert such objects to group
			  * NUMA nodes according to their distances.
			  * See also \ref faq_groups.
			  *
			  * These objects are ignored when they do not bring
			  * any structure.
