 *
 * \return the first object that is included in \p set and whose parent is not.
 *
 * This is convenient for iterating over all largest objects within a CPU set
 * by doing a loop getting the first largest object and clearing its CPU set
 * from the remaining CPU set.
 *
 * \note This function cannot work if the root object does not have a CPU set,
 * e.g. if the topology is made of different machines.
