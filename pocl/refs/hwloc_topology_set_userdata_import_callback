<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='2329'>/** \brief Set the application-specific callback for importing userdata
 *
 * On XML import, userdata is ignored by default because hwloc does not know
 * how to store it in memory.
 *
 * This function lets applications set \p import_cb to a callback function
 * that will get the XML-stored userdata and store it in the object as expected
 * by the application.
 *
 * \p import_cb is called during hwloc_topology_load() as many times as
 * hwloc_export_obj_userdata() was called during export. The topology
 * is not entirely setup yet. Object attributes are ready to consult,
 * but links between objects are not.
 *
 * \p import_cb may be \c NULL if userdata should be ignored during import.
 *
 * \note \p buffer contains \p length characters followed by a null byte (&apos;\0&apos;).
 *
 * \note This function should be called before hwloc_topology_load().
 *
 * \note The topology-specific userdata pointer is ignored when importing from XML.
