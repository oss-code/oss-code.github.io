   * system on which we are running.
   *
   * This forces hwloc_topology_is_thissystem() to return 1, i.e. makes hwloc assume that
   * the selected backend provides the topology for the system on which we are running,
   * even if it is not the OS-specific backend but the XML backend for instance.
   * This means making the binding functions actually call the OS-specific
   * system calls and really do binding, while the XML backend would otherwise
   * provide empty hooks just returning success.
   *
   * Setting the environment variable HWLOC_THISSYSTEM may also result in the
   * same behavior.
   *
   * This can be used for efficiency reasons to first detect the topology once,
   * save it to an XML file, and quickly reload it later through the XML
   * backend, but still having binding functions actually do bind.
