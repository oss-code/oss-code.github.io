<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='2135'>/** \brief Restrict the topology to the given CPU set.
 *
 * Topology \p topology is modified so as to remove all objects that
 * are not included (or partially included) in the CPU set \p cpuset.
 * All objects CPU and node sets are restricted accordingly.
 *
 * \p flags is a OR&apos;ed set of ::hwloc_restrict_flags_e.
 *
 * \note This call may not be reverted by restricting back to a larger
 * cpuset. Once dropped during restriction, objects may not be brought
 * back, except by loading another topology with hwloc_topology_load().
 *
 * \return 0 on success.
 *
 * \return -1 with errno set to EINVAL if the input cpuset is invalid.
 * The topology is not modified in this case.
 *
 * \return -1 with errno set to ENOMEM on failure to allocate internal data.
 * The topology is reinitialized in this case. It should be either
 * destroyed with hwloc_topology_destroy() or configured and loaded again.
