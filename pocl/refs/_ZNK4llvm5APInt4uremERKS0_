  ///
  /// Perform an unsigned remainder operation on this APInt with RHS being the
  /// divisor. Both this and RHS are treated as unsigned quantities for purposes
  /// of this operation. Note that this is a true remainder operation and not a
  /// modulo operation because the sign follows the sign of the dividend which
  /// is *this.

  /// \returns a new APInt value containing the remainder result</doc>
