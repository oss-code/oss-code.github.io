<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Pass.h' l='263'>/// initializePass - This method may be overriden by immutable passes to allow
  /// them to perform various initialization actions they require.  This is
  /// primarily because an ImmutablePass can &quot;require&quot; another ImmutablePass,
  /// and if it does, the overloaded version of initializePass may get access to
  /// these passes with getAnalysis&lt;&gt;.</doc>
