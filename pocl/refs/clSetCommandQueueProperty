     *  WARNING:
     *     This API introduces mutable state into the OpenCL implementation. It has been REMOVED
     *  to better facilitate thread safety.  The 1.0 API is not thread safe. It is not tested by the
     *  OpenCL 1.1 conformance test, and consequently may not work or may not work dependably.
     *  It is likely to be non-performant. Use of this API is not advised. Use at your own risk.
     *
     *  Software developers previously relying on this API are instructed to set the command queue
     *  properties when creating the queue, instead.
