 *
 * If object \p prev is \c NULL, return the first object of type \p
 * type covering at least part of CPU set \p set.  The next invokation
 * should pass the previous return value in \p prev so as to obtain
 * the next object of type \p type covering at least another part of
 * \p set.

 * If there are no or multiple depths for type \p type, \c NULL is returned.
 * The caller may fallback to hwloc_get_next_obj_covering_cpuset_by_depth()
 * for each depth.
 *
 * \note This function cannot work if objects of the given type do
 * not have CPU sets or if the topology is made of different machines.
