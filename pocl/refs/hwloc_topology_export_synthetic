 *
 * At most \p buflen characters will be written in \p buffer,
 * including the terminating \0.
 *
 * This exported string may be given back to hwloc_topology_set_synthetic().
 *
 * \p flags is a OR&apos;ed set of hwloc_topology_export_synthetic_flags_e.
 *
 * \return The number of characters that were written,
 * not including the terminating \0.
 *
 * \return -1 if the topology could not be exported,
 * for instance if it is not symmetric.
 *
 * \note A 1024-byte buffer should be large enough for exporting
 * topologies in the vast majority of cases.
