<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/ADT/PointerSumType.h' l='39'>/// A sum type over pointer-like types.
///
/// This is a normal tagged union across pointer-like types that uses the low
/// bits of the pointers to store the tag.
///
/// Each member of the sum type is specified by passing a \c
/// PointerSumTypeMember specialization in the variadic member argument list.
/// This allows the user to control the particular tag value associated with
/// a particular type, use the same type for multiple different tags, and
/// customize the pointer-like traits used for a particular member. Note that
/// these *must* be specializations of \c PointerSumTypeMember, no other type
/// will suffice, even if it provides a compatible interface.
///
/// This type implements all of the comparison operators and even hash table
/// support by comparing the underlying storage of the pointer values. It
/// doesn&apos;t support delegating to particular members for comparisons.
///
/// It also default constructs to a zero tag with a null pointer, whatever that
/// would be. This means that the zero value for the tag type is significant
/// and may be desirable to set to a state that is particularly desirable to
/// default construct.
///
/// There is no support for constructing or accessing with a dynamic tag as
/// that would fundamentally violate the type safety provided by the sum type.</doc>
