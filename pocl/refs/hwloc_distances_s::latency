				 * May be \c NULL if the distances considered here are not latencies.
				 *
				 * Unless defined by the user, this currently contains latencies
				 * between NUMA nodes (as reported in the System Locality Distance Information Table
				 * (SLIT) in the ACPI specification), which may or may not be accurate.
				 * It corresponds to the latency for accessing the memory of one node
				 * from a core in another node.
				 *
				 * Values are normalized to get 1.0 as the minimal value in the matrix.
				 * Latency from i-th to j-th object is stored in slot i*nbobjs+j.
