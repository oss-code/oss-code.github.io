  /// should come from a previous call to SavePrettyStackState().  This is
  /// useful when using a CrashRecoveryContext in code that also uses

  /// happens after a crash that&apos;s been recovered by CrashRecoveryContext
  /// doesn&apos;t have frames on it that were added in code unwound by the
