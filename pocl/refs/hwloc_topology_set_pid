<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='814'>/** \brief Change which process the topology is viewed from
 *
 * On some systems, processes may have different views of the machine, for
 * instance the set of allowed CPUs. By default, hwloc exposes the view from
 * the current process. Calling hwloc_topology_set_pid() permits to make it
 * expose the topology of the machine from the point of view of another
 * process.
 *
 * \note \p hwloc_pid_t is \p pid_t on Unix platforms,
 * and \p HANDLE on native Windows platforms.
 *
 * \note -1 is returned and errno is set to ENOSYS on platforms that do not
 * support this feature.
