                                          *
                                          * This includes not only the same as the cpuset field, but also the CPUs for
                                          * which topology information is unknown or incomplete, and the CPUs that are
                                          * ignored when the ::HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_WHOLE_SYSTEM flag is not set.
                                          * Thus no corresponding PU object may be found in the topology, because the
                                          * precise position is undefined. It is however known that it would be somewhere
                                          * under this object.
                                          *
                                          * \note Its value must not be changed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used instead.
