   *
   * On some operating systems, some underlying memory binding
   * functions also bind the application to the corresponding CPU(s).
   * Using this flag will cause hwloc to avoid using OS functions that
   * could potentially affect CPU bindings.  Note, however, that using
   * NOCPUBIND may reduce hwloc&apos;s overall memory binding
   * support. Specifically: some of hwloc&apos;s memory binding functions
   * may fail with errno set to ENOSYS when used with NOCPUBIND.
