<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='2243'>/** \brief Export the topology into a newly-allocated XML memory buffer.
 *
 * \p xmlbuffer is allocated by the callee and should be freed with
 * hwloc_free_xmlbuffer() later in the caller.
 *
 * This memory buffer may be loaded later through hwloc_topology_set_xmlbuffer().
 *
 * \return -1 if a failure occured.
 *
 * \note See also hwloc_topology_set_userdata_export_callback()
 * for exporting application-specific object userdata.
 *
 * \note The topology-specific userdata pointer is ignored when exporting to XML.
 *
 * \note Only printable characters may be exported to XML string attributes.
 * Any other character, especially any non-ASCII character, will be silently
 * dropped.
