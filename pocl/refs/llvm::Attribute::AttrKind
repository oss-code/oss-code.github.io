<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/Attributes.h' l='53'>/// This enumeration lists the attributes that can be associated with
  /// parameters, function results, or the function itself.
  ///
  /// Note: The `uwtable&apos; attribute is about the ABI or the user mandating an
  /// entry in the unwind table. The `nounwind&apos; attribute is about an exception
  /// passing by the function.
  ///
  /// In a theoretical system that uses tables for profiling and SjLj for
  /// exceptions, they would be fully independent. In a normal system that uses
  /// tables for both, the semantics are:
  ///
  /// nil                = Needs an entry because an exception might pass by.
  /// nounwind           = No need for an entry
  /// uwtable            = Needs an entry because the ABI says so and because
  ///                      an exception might pass by.
  /// uwtable + nounwind = Needs an entry because the ABI says so.</doc>
