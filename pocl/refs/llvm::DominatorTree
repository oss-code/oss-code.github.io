<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/Dominators.h' l='122'>/// \brief Concrete subclass of DominatorTreeBase that is used to compute a
/// normal dominator tree.
///
/// Definition: A block is said to be forward statically reachable if there is
/// a path from the entry of the function to the block.  A statically reachable
/// block may become statically unreachable during optimization.
///
/// A forward unreachable block may appear in the dominator tree, or it may
/// not.  If it does, dominance queries will return results as if all reachable
/// blocks dominate it.  When asking for a Node corresponding to a potentially
/// unreachable block, calling code must handle the case where the block was
/// unreachable and the result of getNode() is nullptr.
///
/// Generally, a block known to be unreachable when the dominator tree is
/// constructed will not be in the tree.  One which becomes unreachable after
/// the dominator tree is initially constructed may still exist in the tree,
/// even if the tree is properly updated. Calling code should not rely on the
/// preceding statements; this is stated only to assist human understanding.</doc>
