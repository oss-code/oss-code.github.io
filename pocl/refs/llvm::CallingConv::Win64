<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/CallingConv.h' l='146'>/// \brief The C convention as implemented on Windows/x86-64 and
    /// AArch64. This convention differs from the more common
    /// \c X86_64_SysV convention in a number of ways, most notably in
    /// that XMM registers used to pass arguments are shadowed by GPRs,
    /// and vice versa.
    /// On AArch64, this is identical to the normal C (AAPCS) calling
    /// convention for normal functions, but floats are passed in integer
    /// registers to variadic functions.</doc>
