  /// Destroy ConstantArrays in LLVMContext if they are not used.
  /// ConstantArrays constructed during linking can cause quadratic memory
  /// explosion. Releasing all unused constants can cause a 20% LTO compile-time
  /// slowdown for a large application.

  /// NOTE: Constants are currently owned by LLVMContext. This can then only
  /// be called where all uses of the LLVMContext are understood.</doc>
