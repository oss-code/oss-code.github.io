  /// This routine accepts an APInt into which it will accumulate the constant
  /// offset of this GEP if the GEP is in fact constant. If the GEP is not
  /// all-constant, it returns false and the value of the offset APInt is
  /// undefined (it is *not* preserved!). The APInt passed into this routine
  /// must be at least as wide as the IntPtr type for the address space of
  /// the base GEP pointer.</doc>
