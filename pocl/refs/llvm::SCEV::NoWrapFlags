<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/ScalarEvolution.h' l='93'>/// NoWrapFlags are bitfield indices into SubclassData.
  ///
  /// Add and Mul expressions may have no-unsigned-wrap &lt;NUW&gt; or
  /// no-signed-wrap &lt;NSW&gt; properties, which are derived from the IR
  /// operator. NSW is a misnomer that we use to mean no signed overflow or
  /// underflow.
  ///
  /// AddRec expressions may have a no-self-wraparound &lt;NW&gt; property if, in
  /// the integer domain, abs(step) * max-iteration(loop) &lt;=
  /// unsigned-max(bitwidth).  This means that the recurrence will never reach
  /// its start value if the step is non-zero.  Computing the same value on
  /// each iteration is not considered wrapping, and recurrences with step = 0
  /// are trivially &lt;NW&gt;.  &lt;NW&gt; is independent of the sign of step and the
  /// value the add recurrence starts with.
  ///
  /// Note that NUW and NSW are also valid properties of a recurrence, and
  /// either implies NW. For convenience, NW will be set for a recurrence
  /// whenever either NUW or NSW are set.</doc>
