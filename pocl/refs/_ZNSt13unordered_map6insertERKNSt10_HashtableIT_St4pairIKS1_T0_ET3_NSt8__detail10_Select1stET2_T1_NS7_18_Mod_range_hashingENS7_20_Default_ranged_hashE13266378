       *  @brief Attempts to insert a std::pair into the %unordered_map.

       *  @param __x Pair to be inserted (see std::make_pair for easy
       *	     creation of pairs).
       *
       *  @return  A pair, of which the first element is an iterator that 
       *           points to the possibly inserted pair, and the second is 
       *           a bool that is true if the pair was actually inserted.
       *
       *  This function attempts to insert a (key, value) %pair into the
       *  %unordered_map. An %unordered_map relies on unique keys and thus a
       *  %pair is only inserted if its first element (the key) is not already
       *  present in the %unordered_map.
       *
       *  Insertion requires amortized constant time.
