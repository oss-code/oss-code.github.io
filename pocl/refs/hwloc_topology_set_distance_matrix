<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='964'>/** \brief Provide a distance matrix.
 *
 * Provide the matrix of distances between a set of objects of the given type.
 * The set may or may not contain all the existing objects of this type.
 * The objects are specified by their OS/physical index in the \p os_index
 * array. The \p distances matrix follows the same order.
 * The distance from object i to object j in the i*nbobjs+j.
 *
 * A single latency matrix may be defined for each type.
 * If another distance matrix already exists for the given type,
 * either because the user specified it or because the OS offers it,
 * it will be replaced by the given one.
 * If \p nbobjs is \c 0, \p os_index is \c NULL and \p distances is \c NULL,
 * the existing distance matrix for the given type is removed.
 *
 * \note Distance matrices are ignored in multi-node topologies.
