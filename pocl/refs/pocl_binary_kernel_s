 * 1) for integer values, endianness is forced to LITTLE_ENDIAN
 * 2) pointers in general are not written at all, rather reconstructed from data
 * 3) char* strings are written as: | uint32_t strlen | strlen bytes of content |
 * 4) files are written as two strings: | uint32_t | relative filename | uint32_t | content |
