<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/CallingConv.h' l='45'>// Cold - This calling convention attempts to make code in the caller as
    // efficient as possible under the assumption that the call is not commonly
    // executed.  As such, these calls often preserve all registers so that the
    // call does not break any live ranges in the caller side.</doc>
