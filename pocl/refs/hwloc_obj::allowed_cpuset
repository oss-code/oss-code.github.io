                                          *
                                          * This includes the CPUs contained in this object which are allowed for
                                          * binding, i.e. passing them to the hwloc binding functions should not return
                                          * permission errors.  This is usually restricted by administration rules.
                                          * Some of them may however be offline so binding to them may still not be
                                          * possible, see online_cpuset.
                                          *
                                          * \note Its value must not be changed, hwloc_bitmap_dup() must be used instead.
