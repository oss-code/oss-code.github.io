       *  For each consecutive set of elements with the same value,
       *  remove all but the first one.  Remaining elements stay in
       *  list order.  Note that this function only erases the
       *  elements, and that if the elements themselves are pointers,
       *  the pointed-to memory is not touched in any way.  Managing
       *  the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
