 *
 * A new MISC object will be created and inserted into the topology at the
 * position given by parent. It is appended to the list of existing children,
 * without ever adding any intermediate hierarchy level. This is useful for
 * annotating the topology without actually changing the hierarchy.
 *
 * \p name will be copied to the setup the new object attributes.
 * However, the new leaf object will not have any \p cpuset.
 *
 * \return the newly-created object
 *
 * \note If \p name contains some non-printable characters, they will
 * be dropped when exporting to XML, see hwloc_topology_export_xml().
