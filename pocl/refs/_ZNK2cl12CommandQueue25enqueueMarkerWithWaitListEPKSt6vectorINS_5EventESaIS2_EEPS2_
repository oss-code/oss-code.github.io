     * Enqueues a marker command which waits for either a list of events to complete,
     * or if the list is empty it waits for all commands previously enqueued in command_queue
     * to complete before it completes. This command returns an event which can be waited on,
     * i.e. this event can be waited on to insure that all events either in the event_wait_list
     * or all previously enqueued commands, queued before this command to command_queue,
     * have completed.
