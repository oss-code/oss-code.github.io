  /// for size. This is different than the other integer immediate cost
  /// functions in that it is subtarget agnostic. This is useful when you e.g.
  /// target one ISA such as Aarch32 but smaller encodings could be possible
  /// with another such as Thumb. This return value is used as a penalty when
  /// the total costs for a constant is calculated (the bigger the cost, the
  /// more beneficial constant hoisting is).</doc>
