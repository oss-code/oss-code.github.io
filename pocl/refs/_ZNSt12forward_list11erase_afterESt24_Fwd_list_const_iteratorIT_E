       *  @brief  Removes the element pointed to by the iterator following
       *          @c pos.
       *  @param  __pos  Iterator pointing before element to be erased.
       *  @return  An iterator pointing to the element following the one
       *           that was erased, or end() if no such element exists.
       *
       *  This function will erase the element at the given position and
       *  thus shorten the %forward_list by one.
       *
       *  Due to the nature of a %forward_list this operation can be done
       *  in constant time, and only invalidates iterators/references to
       *  the element being removed.  The user is also cautioned that
       *  this function only erases the element, and that if the element
       *  is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched in
       *  any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
