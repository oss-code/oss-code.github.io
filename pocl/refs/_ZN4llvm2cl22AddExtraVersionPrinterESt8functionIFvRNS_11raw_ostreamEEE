/// AddExtraVersionPrinter - Add an extra printer to use in addition to the
///                          default one. This can be called multiple times,
///                          and each time it adds a new function to the list
///                          which will be called after the basic LLVM version
///                          printing is complete. Each can then add additional
///                          information specific to the tool.</doc>
