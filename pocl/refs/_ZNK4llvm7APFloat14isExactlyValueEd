<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/ADT/APFloat.h' l='1122'>/// We don&apos;t rely on operator== working on double values, as
  /// it returns true for things that are clearly not equal, like -0.0 and 0.0.
  /// As such, this method can be used to do an exact bit-for-bit comparison of
  /// two floating point values.

  /// We leave the version with the double argument here because it&apos;s just so
