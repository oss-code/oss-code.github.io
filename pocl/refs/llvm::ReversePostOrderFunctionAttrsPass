///
/// This pass provides a general RPO or &quot;top down&quot; propagation of
/// function attributes. For a few (rare) cases, we can deduce significantly
/// more about function attributes by working in RPO, so this pass
/// provides the complement to the post-order pass above where the majority of
/// deduction is performed.
// FIXME: Currently there is no RPO CGSCC pass structure to slide into and so
// this is a boring module pass, but eventually it should be an RPO CGSCC pass
// when such infrastructure is available.</doc>
