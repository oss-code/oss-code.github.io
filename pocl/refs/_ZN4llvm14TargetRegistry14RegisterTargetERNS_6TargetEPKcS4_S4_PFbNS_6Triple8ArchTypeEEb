  /// RegisterTarget - Register the given target. Attempts to register a
  /// target which has already been registered will be ignored.
  ///
  /// Clients are responsible for ensuring that registration doesn&apos;t occur
  /// while another thread is attempting to access the registry. Typically
  /// this is done by initializing all targets at program startup.
  ///
  /// @param T - The target being registered.
  /// @param Name - The target name. This should be a static string.
  /// @param ShortDesc - A short target description. This should be a static
  /// string.
  /// @param BackendName - The name of the backend. This should be a static
  /// string that is the same for all targets that share a backend
  /// implementation and must match the name used in the &apos;def X : Target ...&apos; in
  /// TableGen.
  /// @param ArchMatchFn - The arch match checking function for this target.
  /// @param HasJIT - Whether the target supports JIT code
  /// generation.</doc>
