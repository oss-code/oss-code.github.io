<doc f='include/hwloc.h' l='1967'>/** \brief Query the physical NUMA node(s) and binding policy of the memory
 * identified by (\p addr, \p len ).
 *
 * This function has two output parameters: \p nodeset and \p policy.
 * The values returned in these parameters depend on both the \p flags
 * passed in and the memory binding policies and nodesets of the pages
 * in the address range.
 *
 * If ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT is specified, the target pages are first
 * checked to see if they all have the same memory binding policy and
 * nodeset.  If they do not, -1 is returned and errno is set to EXDEV.
 * If they are identical across all pages, the nodeset and policy are
 * returned in \p nodeset and \p policy, respectively.
 *
 * If ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT is not specified, \p nodeset is set to the
 * union of all NUMA node(s) containing pages in the address range.
 * If all pages in the target have the same policy, it is returned in
 * \p policy.  Otherwise, \p policy is set to ::HWLOC_MEMBIND_MIXED.
 *
 * If any other flags are specified, -1 is returned and errno is set
 * to EINVAL.
