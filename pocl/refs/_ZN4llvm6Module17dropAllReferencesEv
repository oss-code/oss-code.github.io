<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/Module.h' l='786'>/// This function causes all the subinstructions to &quot;let go&quot; of all references
  /// that they are maintaining.  This allows one to &apos;delete&apos; a whole class at
  /// a time, even though there may be circular references... first all
  /// references are dropped, and all use counts go to zero.  Then everything
  /// is delete&apos;d for real.  Note that no operations are valid on an object
  /// that has &quot;dropped all references&quot;, except operator delete.</doc>
