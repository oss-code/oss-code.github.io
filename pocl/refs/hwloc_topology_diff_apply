 * \p flags is an OR&apos;ed set of ::hwloc_topology_diff_apply_flags_e.
 *
 * The new topology is modified in place. hwloc_topology_dup()
 * may be used to duplicate it before patching.
 *
 * If the difference cannot be applied entirely, all previous applied
 * elements are unapplied before returning.
 *
 * \return 0 on success.
 *
 * \return -N if applying the difference failed while trying
 * to apply the N-th part of the difference. For instance -1
 * is returned if the very first difference element could not
 * be applied.
