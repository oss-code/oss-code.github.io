<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/Analysis/LoopInfo.h' l='512'>/// Returns true if the loop is annotated parallel.
  ///
  /// A parallel loop can be assumed to not contain any dependencies between
  /// iterations by the compiler. That is, any loop-carried dependency checking
  /// can be skipped completely when parallelizing the loop on the target
  /// machine. Thus, if the parallel loop information originates from the
  /// programmer, e.g. via the OpenMP parallel for pragma, it is the
  /// programmer&apos;s responsibility to ensure there are no loop-carried
  /// dependencies. The final execution order of the instructions across
  /// iterations is not guaranteed, thus, the end result might or might not
  /// implement actual concurrent execution of instructions across multiple
  /// iterations.</doc>
