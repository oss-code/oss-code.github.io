       *  @brief  Remove a range of elements.
       *  @param  __pos  Iterator pointing before the first element to be
       *                 erased.
       *  @param  __last  Iterator pointing to one past the last element to be
       *                  erased.
       *  @return  @ __last.
       *
       *  This function will erase the elements in the range
       *  @a (__pos,__last) and shorten the %forward_list accordingly.
       *
       *  This operation is linear time in the size of the range and only
       *  invalidates iterators/references to the element being removed.
       *  The user is also cautioned that this function only erases the
       *  elements, and that if the elements themselves are pointers, the
       *  pointed-to memory is not touched in any way.  Managing the pointer
       *  is the user&apos;s responsibility.
