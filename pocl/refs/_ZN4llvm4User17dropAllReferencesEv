<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/User.h' l='271'>/// \brief Drop all references to operands.
  ///
  /// This function is in charge of &quot;letting go&quot; of all objects that this User
  /// refers to.  This allows one to &apos;delete&apos; a whole class at a time, even
  /// though there may be circular references...  First all references are
  /// dropped, and all use counts go to zero.  Then everything is deleted for
  /// real.  Note that no operations are valid on an object that has &quot;dropped
  /// all references&quot;, except operator delete.</doc>
