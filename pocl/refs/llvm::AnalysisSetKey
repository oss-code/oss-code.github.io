<doc f='include/llvm-6.0/llvm/IR/PassManager.h' l='72'>/// A special type used to provide an address that identifies a set of related
/// analyses.  These sets are primarily used below to mark sets of analyses as
/// preserved.
///
/// For example, a transformation can indicate that it preserves the CFG of a
/// function by preserving the appropriate AnalysisSetKey.  An analysis that
/// depends only on the CFG can then check if that AnalysisSetKey is preserved;
/// if it is, the analysis knows that it itself is preserved.</doc>
