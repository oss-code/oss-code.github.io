   extraction of messages, but does not call gettext().  The run-time
   translation is done at a different place in the code.
   The argument, String, should be a literal string.  Concatenated strings
   and other string expressions won&apos;t work.
   The macro&apos;s expansion is not parenthesized, so that it is suitable as
   initializer for static &apos;char[]&apos; or &apos;const char[]&apos; variables.  */</doc>
