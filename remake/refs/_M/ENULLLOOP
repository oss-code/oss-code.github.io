   returning -1 on failure and setting errno in that case, functions that
   return pointers are not always so well behaved.  Sometimes they return
   NULL for expected behavior: one good example is readdir() which returns
   NULL at the end of the directory--and _doesn&apos;t_ reset errno.  So, we have
   to do it ourselves here.  */</doc>
