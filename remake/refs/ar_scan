<doc f='remake/arscan.c' l='255'>/* Takes three arguments ARCHIVE, FUNCTION and ARG.

   Open the archive named ARCHIVE, find its members one by one,
   and for each one call FUNCTION with the following arguments:
     archive file descriptor for reading the data,
     member name,
     member name might be truncated flag,
     member header position in file,
     member data position in file,
     member data size,
     member date,
     member uid,
     member gid,
     member protection mode,
     ARG.

   The descriptor is poised to read the data of the member
   when FUNCTION is called.  It does not matter how much
   data FUNCTION reads.

   If FUNCTION returns nonzero, we immediately return
   what FUNCTION returned.

   Returns -1 if archive does not exist,
   Returns -2 if archive has invalid format.
   Returns 0 if have scanned successfully.  */</doc>
