<doc f='remake/read.h' l='34'>/*! Search STRING for an unquoted STOPCHAR or blank (if BLANK is nonzero).
   Backslashes quote STOPCHAR, blanks if BLANK is nonzero, and backslash.
   Quoting backslashes are removed from STRING by compacting it into
   itself.  Returns a pointer to the first unquoted STOPCHAR if there is
   one, or nil if there are none.  */</doc>
