<doc f='remake/read.h' l='51'>/*! Given a chain of struct nameseq&apos;s describing a sequence of filenames,
   in reverse of the intended order, return a new chain describing the
   result of globbing the filenames.  The new chain is in forward order.
   The links of the old chain are freed or used in the new chain.
   Likewise for the names in the old chain.

   SIZE is how big to construct chain elements.
   This is useful if we want them actually to be other structures
   that have room for additional info.
