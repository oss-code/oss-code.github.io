   be nice to support this, but it means we&apos;d need to re-run snap_deps() or
   at least its functionality... it might mean changing snap_deps() to be run
   per-file, so we can invoke it after the eval... or remembering which files
   in the hash have been snapped (a new boolean flag?) and having snap_deps()
   only work on files which have not yet been snapped. */</doc>
