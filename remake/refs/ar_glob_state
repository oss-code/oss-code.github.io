<doc f='remake/ar.c' l='191'>/* On VMS, (object) modules in libraries do not have suffixes. That is, to
   find a match for a pattern, the pattern must not have any suffix. So the
   suffix of the pattern is saved and the pattern is stripped (ar_glob).
   If there is a match and the match, which is a module name, is added to
   the chain, the saved suffix is added back to construct a source filename
   (ar_glob_match). */</doc>
